# Compound Interest Calculator

### A nice visual tool for calculating your expected total savings amount with compound interest

This is a project where I'm looking at new technologies and just having fun exploring! Bun seems so fast and sweet, Svelte is on the rise and I have thought about ChartJS for some time!

When I started this project I had to get Bun running on a Windows machine which was not supported at the time. It was tricky but I got it going!
Now that I'm revisiting this project, Bun is supported on Windows which is great!
I had to create the settings.json file to be able to run Bun.

Take a look and test how many years you have to save to be able to retire üòä

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
bun create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
bun create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
bun --bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun --bun run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
bun --bun run build
```



> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
